### Finite State Machines (FSM)

An FSM can be defined mathematically as a quintuple (�,�0,Σ,�,�)(S,s0​,Σ,δ,F), where:

-   �S is a finite set of states.
-   �0s0​ is the initial state, where �0∈�s0​∈S.
-   ΣΣ is a finite set of input symbols (the alphabet).
-   �:�×Σ→�δ:S×Σ→S is the transition function.
-   �⊆�F⊆S is the set of accept states.

In the context of the script:

-   States (�S): Each node in the workflow (e.g., webhook, HTTP request node) represents a state in the FSM.
-   Initial State (�0s0​): The beginning of the workflow or the first node to be executed.
-   Input Symbols (ΣΣ): Inputs can include external HTTP requests, cron triggers, or other events that initiate a state transition.
-   Transition Function (�δ): Defined by the logic that determines the next node to execute based on the current node's outcome (success, failure, etc.).
-   Accept States (�F): The final nodes in the workflow, signifying successful completion.

### Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

A DAG is defined as �=(�,�)G=(V,E), where:

-   �V is a finite set of vertices.
-   �⊆{(�,�)∣�,�∈� and �≠�}E⊆{(u,v)∣u,v∈V and u=v} is a set of edges, with no directed cycles.

The script's workflow can be represented as a DAG, where:

-   Vertices (�V): Each task or node in the workflow.
-   Edges (�E): The dependencies between tasks, where an edge from node �u to node �v implies that �v can only be executed after �u has successfully completed.

#### Application to Workflow Execution

-   Workflow Initialization: The starting point or trigger of the workflow initializes the FSM into its initial state (�0s0​).
-   Task Execution as State Transitions: Executing a task transitions the FSM from one state to another, following the transition function �δ, which in this script is determined by the logic handling the result of each task.
-   Deterministic Execution Flow: Since the workflow is represented as a DAG, it guarantees that for any given input symbol (event trigger), the transition from one state to another is deterministic, preventing cycles and ensuring that each task is executed in a defined order.

### Handling of Parallel Execution and 307 Redirects

Parallel execution paths can be represented in the DAG as branching vertices, where a single node leads to multiple subsequent nodes based on different conditions. The use of 307 HTTP redirects facilitates the FSM's transition across states that are not directly connected in the workflow's linear sequence, allowing for dynamic rerouting based on runtime conditions.

### Mathematical Expressions for Workflow State Updates

The workflow state update, following the execution of a task, can be mathematically expressed as a function of the current state and the task outcome. If ��Si​ represents the current state and ��oi​ the outcome of executing the task associated with ��Si​, then the next state ��+1Si+1​ can be determined by:

��+1=�(��,��)Si+1​=δ(Si​,oi​)

Where �δ incorporates the logic for error handling, success paths, and conditional logic as defined in the workflow.
